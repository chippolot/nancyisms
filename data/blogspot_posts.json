You need to ask your agent lots of questions on what can be changed. Insurance companies do not notify you that your rate will change. They just bill you the higher rate. \n\nI worked all morning and got the rate lowered by asking lots of questions. \n\n\nFancy Nancy Says: If you don't ask the questions about rates, they will bill you the highest amount. The same applies for hotels and airlines. You may be entitled to discounts. Ask for them: Senior rates, AAA rates, Group Rates etc.",

Wrong, they want 40 hours a week, and I can't work 8 hours a day ringing a bell.Perhaps the library could use some help. They said I could put books on a shelf, but I had to fill out an online application to apply and then wait for them to review it. Forget that idea.Maybe the Y would like me to teach some courses? Left my name and so far no reply.I tried my religious organization, the Federation, but they did not need help.Well, I have always enjoyed volunteering at the Chamber. I contacted them and I am waiting for them to reply.I am beginning to feel like one of the group camping out in a New York Park.Well today I was so happy.

Today I felt better than yesterday, but I hope tomorrow I will feel even better. One day at a time. I hate all the dental work , but I still have my teeth.

Candidates need to learn how to have confidence during an interview. They should find out the mission of the job and then show how they can help with present and future missions.I always enjoyed taking an interview. I still enjoy doing it. You can learn in advance what the facility is looking for. Then by networking you can explaing how you can help their mission.Fancy Nancy Says: Learn as much as you can in advance about the company you wnat to work for.",

It happens that things do not always work as planned.I am rewriting my resume after I finish typing this post. When you redo a resume it is important to try to keep the resume to one page. Even though you have done lots of things, when the resume is too long, it loses its impact. I teach resume writing, so I had better listen to my own advice.Fancy Nancy Says: Write only one page for your resume. Condense it for easier reading.",

Betty Cotter, the editor told me where to look . She has been most helpful.So far no dogs have applied, but I am sure when they read our sign they will find a way to reach us.

I find that when I am exhausted, I do not function as well. I don't have extra energy , so I need extra naps to get me feeling better.I am still teaching and with luck my classes will continue in July, Sept, and Oct. I hope to be in Toronto the end of August. The summer is moving along quickly. Right now, it has been very hot in Rhode Island. I don't go to the beach, since I can't take the hot sun. We are lucky and I have some air conditioning in my house. It really helps on hot days. The extreme heat can wear you out, so today, I did my teaching, but I did not do much exercise. Instead, I started to clean out some old records. I learned that you can have them shredded for a small fee. It only cost $2 for three pounds of paper to be shredded.This saved lots of time and energy.

My daughter and husband helped to take us to two Providence doctors yesterday. My kids have been great so far. Marty is getting stronger, but still needs to heal. He is not used to no tennis. For now his strength is limited.His sons are 3000 miles away. So far they have connected by phone , but neither one arrived. At this time, I question their judgement. Next week I will get advice on how best to handle all these situations.It seems someone upstairs is testing my strength. I wrote myself a note. Nancy, you are a wonderful person. You have done a great job. Might as well tell this to myself, since no one else has said it. It is true.Fancy Nancy Says: At times you have to compliment yourself!",

I hope things improve.To my readers, thanks for your patience with my blog. I guess in life there are times when it is tough. They say when things are tough , the tough get going.

I went to line dancing, hand exercises, and then a delicious lunch. The lunch is only $3 and we had a full meal. The pea soup was excellent, and then they served chicken salad with lettuce and tomato and also chocolate pudding for dessert. It is a full meal.I think the program is underwritten by a grant from the government. It is a federal program all over the United States. It is wonderful that they do this for seniors.Today I will attend my writing class as well. Since the sun has disappeared, I might as well enjoy the activities indoors.

They made errors in the transfer. They owe me the money.  If they do not release my money , I will then write to the attorney general's office. Every state has an attorney general, and if you have a problem, send your letter certified mail. There is no charge to get advice from the attorney general. Once they get involved these banks and brokers start to pay attention to your problem. I noticed that Merrill was just fined $10 million for unethical practices. It seems that the SEC has not really monitored its work very carefully in the past. Since the Madoff case ,I hope they have changed their approach.Fancy Nancy says: The best person to monitor your money is YOU  . Don't rely on your broker or your bank. They protect themselves, not you. If you need to complain, go to the right person in writing--- certified mail.",

As a result, if you don't do anything your account will be worth zero. The bank will continue to remove $5 per month until there is no money left.The result is today the brokers and bankers will help you go broke!Fancy Nancy says: We all need to inherit a gold mine in Alaska.

In addition, I already see errors in the account.How do you get accuracy and a broker to help with a small account??? This is a Catch 22 in today's world.My solution is I will win the lottery for $300,000,000 and then everyone will want my account. Then I will buy a seat on the stock exchange so I can trade directly , and I will invite all the small accounts like mine to trade stocks with my new seat on the exchange. Do you like me idea???

Grandmothers save coupons, look for sales, and never go into debt. Our treasury would have a credit instead. Grandmothers think ahead.Grandmothers would never remove social security or medicare. They care about others and do what is good for other grandmothers and grandfathers.Grandmothers hang in there, even when the going is tough. Grandmothers raised large families with no computers, cell phones, washers, dryers, microwave ovens or technology that consumes kids today. Grandmothers told stories, sang songs, gave hugs and kisses, and raised large families during recessions, depressions, wars and conflict. Their kids survived and achieved.Yes, is sounds like a good new plan for our future. Grandmothers are wise, gently, honest and loving. Why not elect us to run the country.Yes, you guessed it, I am a Grandmother.",

She asked me my price and when I told her my guess is they do not want to pay. In any case I have more jobs than I need now. Networking is the name of the game. I find it fun to connect with new folks and learn about what they do. For those who need a job consider talking with the people where you might want to work.

After about 6 holes pushing my baby carriage up and down the hills, I decided this was not fun. I skipped the last few holes and returnd to my car exhausted.When I got home I took a shower and then right on to my nice nap. Since I had exercised in the morning before the Goat Golf Club, I did not realize that this additional exercise was too much for me today.Well, the lesson to learn is \" Pace yourself\" No more Goat Gulf Clubs for Fancy Nancy",

I just wrote to the person who donated the building to Hillel and asked if they could get a mike for next year and I would be happy to make another donation to Hillel. Hope it works out so that next year I could hear the service .I am still teaching, but that ends the end of Sept. In Oct. we plan on visiting Calif. to see family and friends. The weather has been lovely, but it now gets dark earlier. Fall in New England is a very pretty time of year. Happy New Year to all!!!Fancy Nancy says: The New Year brings New Hope!",

He decided the coins were dirty, and so he asked how they could be cleaned. We told him that many old coins are dirty. On the way home he thought he had found a solution. He saw a sign that said, \" Coin  Laundry\". He wanted us to stop. Yes, it was a place to wash clothes and perhaps he was correrct.

The basket is made of stainless steel , and I can see through the mesh-like webbing on the outside.Perhaps I should really think about cleaning out this basket. It is filled with things I may not even know about.

I started by asking sales people in Sears where the bus pass renewal was located. No one knew so they kept sending me to the place where you get the bus.Time was running out, since they are only scheduled to be there for a few hours. Finally, one salesperson knew what I was talking about. She led me to a small table in the heart of the mall and there they were. Well, I paid my money, got my new 5 year pass, and was amazed that 90% of the stores in the mall no longer existed. Wow, Rhode Island is really in recession.I hope  to go back to Newport to try to sell my book to Salve Regina College. I will use my new bus pass. What a deal .

I finally found a firm that would accept a smaller account, and I will give them a try. The cough is getting better, and the car is now packed and ready to go.As we age our body parts do not always cooperated. We need more time to rest and recuperate.

Instead of protecting the client, he was only protecting himself. He gave me very poor advice, and I quickly told him that we could never work together. He asked for an outrageous fee for a P and S ( Purchase and Sale Agreement). In fact there is no required amount by law and any amount would work. The money would go into his escrow account with no interest. I have a valid real estate license , and I am glad that I know the law.

The production was very well done. It did last a full three hours , but the cast did a great job. We sat in the front row, so we actually felt like we were nearly part of the cast.We could see the orchestra pit, and the orchestra leader was clearly visible. The price was very reasonable for the show, only $35 per ticket. It was well worth the price.Fancy Nancy Enjoyed Tennis and A Wonderful Show!",

The President was busy so she left her a note with a nice man who works there.Fancy Nancy explained the problem to the nice banker she  had not received the signed letter of agreement that she needed to continue her work.Fancy Nancy told the bank representative that if this bank did not want her program she deals with many other banks who would be interested.Later that day the President called Fancy Nancy.She learned that the required letter had gone to the legal department of the bank for review. That meant that the signed letter would not be returned until at least a week, if then. No one had told this to Fancy Nancy. The President said that the bank wants the program, but the delay was due to the fact that the letter had to go to the main office in North Carolina.Fancy Nancy called the President and said that it was helpful to know what was happening. Fancy Nancy will continue preparing the list, since the restaurant reservation has been booked by the bank. The problem was that the President had not taken the time to update Fancy Nancy. The President was undergoing a change in staff and other complications. Fancy Nancy told the President that bank invitations would still be needed and as soon as the needed letter is signed the list will go to the bank so that someone in the bank can create the invitations and get them out.Fancy Nancy already has ten ladies who want to attend and so she will keep the seminar date booked and wait for the lawyers to finish their review.Communication is the name of the game. When dealing with businesses Fancy Nancy has learned that they are busy, but they often fail to communicate the facts, and as a result, this creates problems. The nice man who helped Fancy Nancy will now handle her account in the future, since her representative quit her job.

We may be at a standstill, but that is okay . There are lots of banks around and they all need new customers. If this bank won't sign, then I could market the program to another bank.

I still need more students for Speed Reading , but with time some will arrive.It has been a real challenge to start a new program at a facility that never offered programs for the mind . They always had only programs for kids and programs for the body. I am happy that my program is working.This afternoon we had a unique birthday party . There were 60 folks who arrived. The unusual part was that the guests had to pay for their own dinners. They did have an acting group perform. I have never been to a birthday party where the guests paid for the dinner. Maybe this is a new style of entertaining. I found it very strange!Fancy Nancy Enjoys Her New Writing Class!",

The weather finally got nicer so it was great to be outside enjoying a beautiful day.From tennis I went to see another condo at my golf course location. The person I called just left the door open , and told me to take a look . I did , and although the unit is older , it was clean and in good shape. I called the owner and and at first the husband said he would only sell at the list price. I told him that I was interested, but not at the list price.Not even ten minutes later his wife contacted me,and asked what I would bid. I gave her a low bid, and she said she would check the price of other units, and she would get back to me.I will wait for her reply by E-mail . In the meantime, I have my price limit in mind, and I would be interested only if they meet my price. Time will tell, but it is a challenge to negotiate.Fancy Nancy considers a real estate deal.",

I always have fun prizes and this year I asked everyone to think of what I could do with a bargain I bought at a consignment store to $3. It was a very long white silk piece of material that could be used as a drapery on a window. I asked everyone to suggest how I could use it. The funniest answers included the following:   1. Return it and get your money back 2. Use it to cover my plants in the cold weather  3. Use it for a Circque Soleil routine. 4. Dump it! 5. Have students sign it with their names.The winner got the huge white curtain to take it home to cover her plants. We had a lot of laughs with their ideas. They also told us what they were doing in writing since last year. They really enjoy these reunions, and I have fun seeing everyone as well. I ran this group called the Writing Workshop for 18 years.I then looked at a condo for sale at a nearby golf course. The place was a mess, and the renter in their now was a smoker. The bed was not made, the kitchen was filthy, and overall the condo was old. Even though the owner only wants $115,000, it would need to be repainted  and fixed up. The condo overlooks the golf course , and that is a plus. The owner is 84 years old, and he says he wants to sell since he has some medical issues. I gave him a Valentine's present for his wife. I do not think I will give him even a low offer to buy the place. It was fun to see it though.Fancy Nancy says Valentine's Day is fun and our annual class reunion.",

Finally , I shared my idea of using an umbrella stroller as a protection when crossing the street. My stroller is such a help. I carry all my things in it, and it saves my back as well.

This beats waiting for the ladies group I belong to who said I could not offer anything until next season.When you deal with a ladies group you have to comply with their rules, even if it does not make good sense. I am better off planning my own programs. I seem to be good at getting things running and off the ground.This Sunday we have a class reunion for a writing class that I taught for 18 years.

Usually, when I do a program for pay, I go directly to the person in charge and make an agreement. Doing volunteer programs could be okay, but they present a different format.I will have to review whether I am willing to go through the hurdles of the chain of command when there is a different process and no pay. For the moment, I need to rethink what my priorities are. In the meantime , I will not make any final decisions about next season until I have more information for future planning.I do know that once you are dealing with committees of ladies, it can take a lot longer to accomplish your goals. Time will tell about my decision, but for now I will research other options.I was willing to put a program into effect this spring, but the powers that control the program did not want to agree. As a result, I might reconsider my offer regarding programs for next season. I am a person of action, and I don't know if I will be willing to deal with a chain of command for no pay. Perhaps I will look further for other options. In the meantime, I work today and never know if any students will arrive at the program I offer in the park.

I accepted the reduction, since I do want to teach there. It seems that economically, there are lots of job cuts even in  teaching.I enjoyed listening to a lecture this morning on Vietman, the 21st century. It was given by a professor from Florida Gulf Coast University. One benefit I do get there is that I can take some free lectures for certain programs. This professor's son married a girl from Vietnam, so he has visited the country three times. He said women are still second rate citizens there, and the family has a strong hold on all the members. Loyalty , conforming to family tradition, and respect for elders are essential. The individualism of the west is not encouraged. He really knew his subject .His son is back in the United States and he and his Vietnam wife are having a hard time finding employment. I do not think that the recession is over, even though Washington says it is. When people continue to lose jobs they have no money to spend. As a result, I think our economy has not yet recuperated. We still are having economic problems in the United States, and probably other countries are dealing with the same problems. We are a global economy. As a result most economic declines exist everywhere.Fancy Nancy is still out there marketing . She does have some new ideas for other programs.",

        "content": "This week I had to do some banking. I have learned that it definitely pays to take the time to shop for the best bank rates. There is a definite difference in what the banks are offering. I have also learned that the different banks also have various rates depending on where you opened the account. If you call customer service they will ask you in what state is your account?The rules vary a great deal on renewing a new CD for your account. Some banks require more than a phone call to customer service. In addition, when you call the rates can vary from day to day. Sometimes you can even call the bank directly, and if  you like the rate they will let you lock in and then as soon as they get a check for the money, your new rate begins.This year since interest rates have been low, I have been going for the best rate, even if it is long term. You can always take a penalty if you wish to take your money out before it matures. Usually, if a new rate is two points higher than the rate you have, it may be worth it to cash in the lower rate CD.Learning about banks can be a full time job. In the long run, it does pay to take the time to do your homework. You are your best investor, and once you learn to do your homework, you will be the winner.

If things do not work for you, maybe it is time to see things from a different point of view. It would be like looking at things sideways, backwards, and even upside down. You will definitely get a new perspective on your actions. There are times that everyone gets stuck. The trick is to get \" unstuck\".

Now I  have to bring it into the house to see if it really works. The sign on the machine said in working order, but one never knows until you try it.I am not a master at sewing machines, but in this case, I feel that the Bargain Box deserves the money . They are a church charity, and when you buy there, they put the money to good charitable use. I often drop off bags of used items I do not want. I also seem to find items that I need. I have used the Bargain Box for 25 years, and they used to have furniture as well. Needless to day, some of the items in my home came from this wonderful place.You too can save money if you find your local bargain place.

I have several students for my writing workshop, a new program that was never offered before at one of the local parks.Today I was to teach Speed Reading, but do to an expected bout of illness, I had to cancel. As it turned out, it was okay, since they did not have any students yet for that class.Time will tell if it will run. In any case , the writing program will continue. It is so nice to be able to use my computer again and have a phone. You become very dependent on technology, and when it does not work, it is difficult to let people know why you aren't responding.Tonight we have a movie club meeting,  and since the meeting is at my house, I decided not to cancel. I took some medication and I do feel better, so I should be okay for the meeting.Love to hear from you and Fancy Nancy says, \"Keep in touch!\"",

I guess the Florida power lines can't take the cold we are experiencing.This morning was my first day teaching at Fleischman's Park. I go dancing at the same place, and suggested that they add a writing course. The students only pay $5 and they can come as often as they wish. I was happy to have two students today, and they both said they would come back next week as well. Tomorrow I hope to have students for my Speed Reading at the same place. I do enjoy the teaching, and I hope others will soon attend as well.The sun is out today, so it will probably get a bit warmer. I just got approved to do a lecture for a program that just started last year at URI. If it fills then they may want more sessions in the fall. Time will tell. Hope our communication services soon get repaired. In the meantime, I am using the computer at a hotel.Fancy Nancy says cold weather freezes communication services at Comcast. Keep in touch.",

        "date": "3:13 PM",
        "content": "My blog on toilet paper has led to some interesting facts from a reader. Here's what I learned. Scott Paper Company marketed the first rolls of toilet paper. The company was founded in 1879 by two brothers Irvin and Clarence Scott. In 1896 Irvin's son Arthur joined the company and convinced his father and uncle to have a private label business named Waldorf. In 1921 Waldorf represented 64% of Scott's total sales. By 1925 Scott became the leading toilet paper company in the world. In 1995, Scott was acquired by Kinberly Clark.So much more information is available about toilet paper. Maybe I should look into buying some shares, since  the product won't go out of style. It seems that the products we take for granted might be the very products we should invest in.Today was a social day. I invited 4 of my former writing workshop class members for lunch. We enjoy keeping in touch and each Valentine's Day we have a class reunion. I ran a Writing Workshop for 18 years before I started to teach for Florida Gulf Coast University, Learning in Retirement program. The project was great fun and several students in our class attended for the entire 18 years. We are all a bit older, but we all still enjoy writing.Fancy Nancy says maybe I should look into investing in toilet paper shares along with oranges. Keep in touch.",

        "content": "Today I went to my Saturday morning writing class. I do not teach this class but attend. We have a woman who facilitates the group and this morning in spite of cold and rain 16 people arrived.Usually our leader writes and shares her one page piece with all of us. We each have one word as a topic and then we write only one page and read it to the group. My one word today was new for the New Year. I encouraged the group to try something new and listed the new things I am doing.Our leader used two words, lost cause. She talked about how the size of the toilet paper roll has shrunk, but the price is the same or higher. She even brought in  the end of the roll with no paper on it and compared it to prior rolls. She said she could write to Congress about the shrinkage, but she felt it would be a lost cause. I thought the subject was a riot, and the class roared as she passed around old toilet paper samples.In my class we have snow birds from everywhere. We meet once a week and this group has been ongoing for at least five years . We previously met at the local library, but they are no longer open Sat. mornings. Now we meet at a local church and today we made a donation for the use of the room.The range of writing talent is wide, and even those who had no talent have improved greatly. It is fun to reconnect with the group even though we only see each other once a week. This class is what triggered the material for my book SNIPPETS.An update on Florida weather: Tonight it will be about 30 and they suggested we could have some snow. I am using all my winter clothes. Maybe it is a good time to invest in oranges. For sure the new crop will freeze.Fancy Nancy says , \" Visit Florida , and pack your ski clothes. You will need them for sure!\"",

There were 10 new members there and it was held in an area called Barefoot Beach. I had never been there before, but it was lovely. The condo overlooked the Gulf of Mexico. I learned today that this Women's Cultural Group sponsored by the Federation now has 370 members. I volunteered to do some programs for them next Dec. before I start my paid teaching. There was one guest who was 92 years old . She looked great and still travels, entertains , and lives alone. Some people definitely have the right genes.Overall, this was a fun day . It has been quite cold this week and we are due for more cold weather. I am now using my winter coat in Florida.Fancy Nancy meets 10 new ladies.

In the meantime I am trying other things. Tomorrow I start Spanish and I even booked a golf lesson to help my lousy golf game.The best plan when waiting on jobs is to keep cool. Based on this weather , that is not hard to do. The economy has not really recovered, so jobs are not readily available. For those out of work, try to keep a balance in your life. Start a new course or volunteer until something locks in .Otherwise you could be too frustrated. Not always easy to maintain your emotional balance, but exercise will definitely help out.Fancy Nancy says, \" It pays to keep cool\"",

I never thought about that until today.We had a quiet New Years Eve. That is a good night to stay home. I will find out in January if any of my classes will run. In the meantime I have been hitting tennis balls with a friend, and playing my fun golf.This week I start Spanish again.

Have not heard from you, so I will begin.Well, I was thinking I might try to learn how to play chess. That would be new for me . My grandson is a whiz at the game, and I have never played. Perhaps if I go online and hit chess, I could begin to learn how to play. It would be fun to be able to play a game of chess with himI am also trying to learn more about golf. I got a book and it said women should put more time into putting, since that is a big part of the game. I have never read a book about golf, but I learned some good pointers.Trying something new is very stimulating. It is always a challenge and it is good for both the body and the mind. I have discovered that when others are no longer able to do something that have enjoyed, too often they are at a loss for something new to take its place. I have tennis friends that can't play tennis any longer, and at first they are sad since we all miss what we have enjoyed. Here are some fun things to try for the New  Year.     1. Chess 2. Line Dancing 3. A foreign language 4. A blog 5. Painting 6. Computer GamesI think I will go online now and try to find Chess to see what I can learn.Fancy Nancy says Happy New Year with a focus on the word New. Send me your comments.",

        "content": "Well, Christmas was yesterday, and I hope everyone had a nice holiday. In the morning I wrote two new facilities about course proposals. I have no idea if either one will be interested, but it never hurts to send them information. I suggested that both places could offer one-stop exercising. This way folks could exercise and at the same facility they could take courses for the mind. ( Exercising the body and mind at one place makes sense.)The first place is a fancy golf course. Many of the members are getting older, so probably Writing Your Life Story would be a program of interest. The second place is a huge wellness center. I sent both facilities a list of four courses . My next step after they get the information , is to keep in touch and see if there is interest.Since I learned there is a time line on the insurance program, I decided to hold off for now. I don't want to get overbooked . Once I start my teaching I won't have time to work on insurance information. The man in charge was wonderful. He let me try the course and he did not even charge me for a short trial. It was online that I learned there is a 90 day time line.

I also suggested to them that they offer courses for the mind as well as the body. They also want to see more information.Both places offer possiblities for teaching. I just need to discover how much time I will have since I am already booked at two facilities. It will depend upon enrollment. If enrollment does not come in, then I would be looking for places to teach. I will probably send proposals to both facitlites to make a connection.When I left this morning for my golf club appointment to learn about this club I never thought that I would end up perhaps working for them. Who knows what will happen, but it is always fun to make new connections. The course that I visited wants $100,000 non-refundable initiation fee. Perhaps their members could afford a writing course as well.Upon review the course deals are everywhere, but the prices even for the deals run $5,000 and up. Wow, golf can be an expensive proposition.For now Fancy Nancy will play her short , inexpensive course. Tennis is much cheaper. It is fun to learn about all the courses in our area. I am meeting lots of membership directors. It seems that many of the golf clubs will have a tough time with the recession.

I will think about it, and before I do anything I will go online to see if there is already a children's book with that same title.Ofcourse even if there is, the writing rules say that you can not copyright a title, so Fancy Nancy 's Adventures would still be possible. It seems that Fancy Nancy often gets into trouble, and my job is to help her out. What do you readers think about a book about Fancy Nancy's adventures? Love to hear from you. In the meantime enjoy the holidays and relax if you can.Fancy Nancy considers writing about more future adventures.",

Today the library informed me that I have violated the copy rules and only their white paper can be used. Fancy Nancy shall make a library donation next week to keep them friendly. So much for the copy machine caper. I never knew you can't use your own colored paper in their machine. Too many rules to learn in this world today!Tonight we saw a fun play called Naples City Imrov. Players performed a series of games that were unscripted and based on some game show. The cast was amatuer, but very talented. A fun evening.Fancy Nancy learned today that her golf partner the other  day is the club champion. No wonder her balls soared as mine plopped on the turf. I had no idea when invited that she is the best lady player at that club. She had contacted me to enourage new membership. All the clubs are looking for new members and are happy to let you try their golf course. What a deal!Fancy Nancy will have to take a Follow the Rules Course in 2010.",

We bailed them out, and now they are charging us for everything. Something is wrong with the system. We should be charging them for the taxpayers money  that we loaned them.I got about 10 pages of rules and information.

I went with a friend to a movie at the office of the Federation. About one hour into the film flashing lights and loud sounds started blaring. All I know is, everyone left the building and the fire trucks were on their way. Needless to say, we did not return to see the end of the movie, but the flick was not very good anyway. So much for today's excitement. Then I got home, and Marty said he backed up at the tennis court and hit a car. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Tonight I called my insurance company. I was lucky that several years ago I put him on my auto insurance policies. The insurance company will cover any damage to the other car, and other than a few scratches, my old car is fine.Each new day is a new adventure! Fancy Nancy moves on!",

She is so happy when people enjoy them. The creative canes can match any outfit, and she even did one for a bride . The cane matched the bride's outfit perfectly.So, if you want a creative gift for the holidays, whether it is a cane, a book, or a special holiday story or greeting, please contact Fancy Nancy at Nshu4@aol.com.Love to hear from you.Fancy Nancy Announces Unique Holiday Gifts!",

No scores needed for her. Even water is no problem as she carries the ball past all obstacles. Since she had no partners, playing was a breeze. The best part is the walk and the price. Wow, was she happy to discover this convenient course nearby.Evidently the golf course has been here for many years, but this is the first year that Fancy Nancy found it. Up until this year, Nancy played more tennis. Now, to play it safe, she is limiting the tennis and turning to another sport. Hooray for the discovery of inexpensive golf that lets you walk the course even with a baby carriage. Even Tiger Woods can't top that!Fancy Nancy Finds Cheap Golf in Naples! A Miracle Happens !",

Who knows what Obama's new plans will be?I am sure that others have the same confusion. Well, I shall go online and try to figure it out. One day at a time.Fancy Nancy tries to pick a medical plan.",

Next, they invested in some property, and they knew the right time. They seem to know what will work in real estate. As a result, their ideas have paid off.They are both very bright and they seem to have a gift for picking the right properties at the right time. They make it look easy, but it takes a talent to know when to buy and when to sell. So far their talent has paid off.Now their daughter Rebecca will learn from them. The apples do not fall far from the tree. Their kids are lucky to have great parents who have shared their love and their knowledge. They are both very humble, but I will brag for them. Congratulations to you both on raising great kids, and knowing what is up in real estate today. You truly are the experts!!!Fancy Nancy applauds Lynn and Tavit the Entrepreneurs of Real Estate",

Both he and his son Andrew have a wonderful gift. They care about people, and as a result, people care about them.When you are with Steven, he always takes the time to talk to others as well. That is why he  liked going to the beach. While there, he was like the mayor, he knew everyone. That is a real gift.This summer I was lucky to have lots of unexpected visits from Steve. He would walk over, pop in , enjoy his ice cream and a newspaper and a chat. What a treat for me! Now that we are leaving for Florida , I will miss his weekly visits. Perhaps he will visit us in Florida as well.In any case, I am lucky to have enjoyed these surprise visits this summer. Steven cares about his family and friends and as a result, he is loved by many. I am lucky to have him in my life.Lucky Fancy NancyPS Fancy Nancy is lucky to have a wonderful family. The next few blogs will be called Steven and Family Blogs---",

With luck we will continue and then when I return they may want more classes.It is wonderful to have an opportunity to connect with lovely folks who I would never meet normally without a class. In a short time you can feel a strong new connection exists. I hope I have helped them, and they have definitely enriched my life. That is the fun part of teaching.Rhode Island is now getting cold, and I look forward to relocating to a warmer climate. I have enjoyed writing this blog, and hope to continue writing it as we move on. It is always fun to get your comments, and I so appreciate the fact that someone takes the time to read it.

This is medical week and so it was the ear doctor this morning and the dentist this afternoon. I am still working on finding a good place to celebrate my big birthday in June. The hotels I checked out so far, will not work.This summer went well. We visited California, and had a wonderful trip. I took care of several dental problems, and teaching worked out well. I was happy to say my that staying in Narragansett was fine. In the past, my allergies were tough here, but this season I was okay.Relocating always involves some planning, so I have been changing addresses, cleaning out closets, and reorganizing records for our trip to Florida. I now have a new car, and it should work out well for the 1700 mile drive there.Some folks don't like the idea of living different locations, but I really love it. The preparation is just part of the move. Once we are there we reconnect with friends and enjoy the \"winter camp\" activities that take place. I hope to start teaching again in January, and that is always fun.This blog has been a new adventure, and I have enjoyed writing daily. I really love it when you send me your comments.

        "content": "I have enjoyed my 23 year old Maytag for many years. Up until today, I never had to spend any money on this amazing machine. This past week my Maytag started to leak. Since we are leaving for Florida shortly, it did not pay to even think about replacing it at this time.The best bet was to call a serviceman and let him diagnose the problem. I called two companies, and over the phone they had different opinions. It reminded me of my doctors. Well, at first I was confused. Which company should I use?I thought about the question, and based on the fact that one company was nearer and would come sooner, they won out. I was concerned about my decision since the closer company wanted $90 just for a diagnosis.Well I took a chance and today they arrived. They diagnosed the problem , replaced a $9 part, and my old Maytag is happy again. So is Fancy Nancy who loves this old machine. The machines from that period were made by Maytag. Today, Whirlpool makes the Maytag, and based on my newer Florida washer, the old ones were much better.I am happy to report that the $99 I spent was well worth it. There was a time before I finalized my decision that I questioned my plan. Now, I am happy with the results, and based on what the serviceman told me, he was sorry he got rid of his old Maytag.Perhaps the lesson here seems to repeat itself. After you have thought about a solution, you have to feel good about your choice. A recent book that I read about decisions stated that there is a rational part of decision-making, but there should also be an emotional part as well. If the outcome is positive, you will like the result, and you feel happy about your choice. The book also said too many choices can confuse a person. I agree with that as well.It is hard to know in advance if your decision is correct, but I feel best once I have made a decision. I can't sit too long on an issue without  some sort of resolution. Even if I make the wrong decision I can accept that. Indecision is what upsets me the most.So now Fancy Nancy and her Maytag are happy again and my $99 was a bargain. It all depends on how you look at things! I think I saved money by not considering at new washer. Time will tell if I was right.Fancy Nancy Fixes the Old Maytag!",

She said it was one of the few places that has a small kitchen for food any time of day.We saw the rooms and they were very nice. The hotel would give us a 20% discount for a family reunion. Next, they mentioned a nice restaurant, so we had a small snack there. The food was good. Because the weather was lovely, we enjoyed watching the boats go by.

        "content": "Today, I had my job interview, and if New England Tech has needs next summer, I may be teaching there as well. I do love to  teach, so perhaps I will be teaching at two places, the Y and the college. With part-time programs you must be most flexible since most places base their teaching needs on enrollment. Often this is a last minute situation.Next, I attended a seminar at the Crowne Plaza. The title of the program was Wall St. and Main St. The seminar talked about stock market trading with puts and calls. The speaker talked much too fast, and when I wrote a note saying SLOW DOWN, his answer was ,\" I will never get through all the material.\". It did not matter to him that no one was able to understand him. His goal was to \" Just get done!\"I have taught public speaking and one of the first rules is to notice if your audience is with you. He was more concerned with spouting all the information, and he had no idea what was going on with the listeners. My guess is he could use the basic public speaking course.Tonight I listened to an excellent speaker who is also my audiologist from Mass. She was invited to speak at the library and her subject was about new equipment in the field . It was definitely worth listening to her. She knows her subject well, and she was always concerned about her audience. What a difference in speakers.I really enjoyed the day and learned about different topics. The fun part is learning, and it seems that teaching and learning are two sides of the same process. We learn from each other and the teacher learns from her students. That is why it definitely pays to listen.There is a saying,\" God gave us two ears and only one mouth\". We should listen twice as much based on what we have been given. It is good advice. If you let the other person talk, they will think you are wonderful. You don't have to say a thing, but you will have made points!Happy Listening from Fancy Nancy",

When I got home I tried the same method on my computer and it would not work. My guess is there must be a problem with my computer, since it will not allow me to edit a post.I give up, and the only answer is to not make a mistake so that I do not have to edit my blogs. Today was another dental gum surgery day, and although they call it a deep cleaning, based on the price and the number of shots of numbing medication, it really is more surgery to clean under the gum areas. Not fun, but I guess needed.The good news is that I shipped most of my published books to friends and family and I may have to make some more copies. I shall try a new source for copying. We are starting to get organzied for relocation, and before long it will be time to leave the north and head south--just like the birds!This summer has been productive and we have enjoyed travel to California plus time with family and friends. I do like living in different locations, since we have friends now in Florida as well. The year flies by when you relocate. I have enjoyed my courses at the Y, and I hope to teach there again when I return to Rhode Island in the spring.Tomorrow I have a new job interview, so time will tell if this job will fit with my schedule. I do enjoy taking interviews, and you always learn something you never knew before the interview. There are jobs out there, but you have to be most creative to find them in today's job market. Perhaps my computer has the flu, and with time it may recover, but for now forget editing my blogs, my computer won't cooperate.",

I will appreciate your ideas!Today I reconnected with a high school friend who I had not seen in years. We were to meet at noon at a nearby restaurant. I got there early, and I saw a woman in the restaurant, but she had gray hair, and did not look like the girl I knew at age 16. Well, she walked by, and I saw her leaving the restaurant.Since we were the only ones there at noon, I just guessed that had to be my high school classmate. I found her and we reconnected. I guess she did not recognize me as well. Perhaps in the future we will need to check in advance and wear some item like you would with a blind date.This way we would not walk by one another and not know who it is.We had a lovely time catching up even though many years have gone by. I guess it is never to late to reconnect.  The amazing thing is that in high school some of the girls in the class were not that friendly. Now over 50 years later they are delightful. Does that mean people get better with age? Who knows1The lesson to remember is take the time to reconnect with people.

I was just thrilled to hear from him. What is joy it is to know that someone is reading and enjoying my writing.As a project writing can be lonely, but once you have comments from your readers, it makes the project lots of fun. That is why I keep taking and teaching writing. I am in a small class at the Y, and I am teaching Life Story writing there as well.Next week, I have another job interview at New England Technical College. I just found out that they offer programs year round. I don't know the details yet, but it is always worth an interview. I am booked for one on Wednesday. Who knows what will happen, but it is always valuable to network and take interviews.I never called for an interview, but I went to a talk at the senior center, and the speaker talked about writing during the Depression , and I found out that she is head of writing at that college.By networking, I got the interview and I will meet with her this week. In a tough economy, networking is the name of the game.No one is hiring, but if you know someone, and they like you, they may even create a new job. You have nothing to lose, and right now in Rhode Island the job market is grim.So the next time you hear someone speak, or you meet someone who is interesting, introduce yourself, and connect. Make yourself a business card, even if you don't have a business. Put your name on your card, your full address, phone and skills. People do hold onto these cards. You can even use the back of the card for more information. Keep your cards with you, and the next thing you know, they will get you your future job.I have several cards, and I just made a new one with my two addresses. You could do the same, with your college and home address. Not only is the card good for jobs, but if you meet a wonderful new potential date, give that person your card. Your social and business life will be on a roll. Let me know how your new card has changed your life!!Thanks for reading and sharing.Fancy Nancy --It is all is the CARDS1",

I did find out that the bus no longer goes from my street, so next I would have to drive to a nearby location. Fine, I got there on time. The only problem was I was standing across the street from where the Newport bus picks up. As a result, I was not in the right place. I saw the bus go by, and missed it. Now it was time to try to make it to the railroad station and find the bus there. I made it , and the driver said,\" I am on break, so come back in 10 minutes\". I parked at the free parking in the station and ran back and made it. Great! The trip was a bargain. With my senior pass only 85 cents for the one hour ride. Much better than paying the new bridge rates. One hour later i was in Newport. Parked in the harbor was a huge  passenger cruise boat that had docked. It had 18 decks and 3.000 people. Boy , I bet the merchants were so happy for the inflow of customers. I enjoyed watching them line up as they boarded a launch that would take them back to the ship. I spoke with a young man from Russia who works on board. Then back to the bus terminal to return to Narragansett for another 85 cents. I enjoyed the lovely colors of the tress as we are now in the fall season. One hour later I was back at the station and I picked up my car. After returning home, I called to see if my new book was ready. No, they replied , the machine to correct their errors was broken and they did not know when it would be fixed. I was furious. I went to the Staples store and was ready to cancel the whole order since after 10 days it was not done. Marty went with me since I was so mad, I did not trust myself to be calm. In any case the girl in charge said I could get a full refund. She did not know when the machine would be ready. What she omitted to tell me, was that I would get the books eventually for free. My anger diminished, and I am still waiting, but the price was right. I never knew until today that if they goof and you are unsatisfied, then your order is free. This was from Staples. I  have used them in the past, but I never had seen their sign about free orders. Needless to say, I calmed down. I am still waiting for my order, but the price is now right. I guess life is like that . We all have roller coaster days. The trick is to roll with the punches. Blogs are great for venting!!!!Fancy Nancy vents on her blog!",

They had misplaced the order, and finally they found it and even though it was a week late, I wanted to see the results. When I got home I started to pack and ship my new baby to friends and family. Priority envelopes were ready, and I quickly stuffed the new book into the envelopes and had them ready for shipping. Fortunately, before sealing the packages I decided to do a final proof reading. I must have proofed it at least six times before Staples the printer got it. In any case it was a wise move. I was near the final section and suddenly I realized that one of my stories was missing the second page. Oh no! I kept on reading . About four pages later, I found the second page. Guess what I had to do next! I could not allow the book to go out with this error. I undid all the packages, called Staples, and this morning I was back there with all of the copies needing to be fixed. Now they had been a week late, misplaced a page, and vowed that the book would be ready tomorrow morning. Tonight the phone rang. It was Staples. Their machine broke down, so it will take a bit longer. I must admit that patience is a virtue. They did give me a slight discount, but it seems that even though you do your proofing, others may not give it the same attention. Well, I taught this morning and our writing focused on the word confusion. I decided that there is a lot of confusion in our world today. The lesson I have to learn is not to expect the results on time. In this way you will not be disappointed, and frustration will begin to disappear. Luckily I do not have a deadline to meet. I am more relaxed today about the project. With some good luck I may get the book fixed by tomorrow. If not, it will be time to ask for more discounts!",

I hope that he will be able to carry forward the mission even though it is a bit early to see how it will be done. He is most articulate, and he has been well-received overseas. Now the question is how can he go forward with his view for world peace? He has to decide what to do with the ongoing wars. Will he add more troops after getting this award? It will be interesting to see if the award will influence his thinking . Only time will give the answers. Fancy Nancy and the Nobel Peace Award",

        "content": "Today I was most pleased with the results of a Lahey Clinic apt . with a skin doctor. I had consulted a Rhode Island skin doctor, and they were going to do a biopsy on my lip. Before I would allow it, I decided it makes good sense to go to a dermatologist at Lahey Clinic.I called on Monday and I was lucky to get my apt. in five days. In Rhode Island it can takes months to get booked. We went to Burlington last night so that we could be on time for my 9am apt. The doctor I saw is Director of a skin cancer program, so my guess is that she is quite familiar with the subject.After a consultation and exam, she said, I do not think you need a biopsy. Boy was I glad that I went there instead of just the one opinion from Rhode Island. She told me to watch the area, and if there was swelling or a change, then get another apt. wherever I was. Otherwise she said,\"See you in a year!\".What a difference. It seems that it definitely makes good sense to go to Lahey Clinic when you need some reliable advice. My daughter told me that she left her skin doctor in Florida, since every apt. her wanted to do a biopsy. When the doctors are  paid by the hospital clinic, they seem to be less greedy and less pressured.In any case, I was happy I went. Otherwise I would have done the procedure. I know in the past there have been several times both in Florida and in Rhode Island that tests were suggested, and when I checked it out at Lahey, the tests were not needed.I think when it comes to medicine the patient is much better off in the large clinic since the doctors are paid a fixed salary, and they do not have to support a private practice.I was relieved and pleased that I went further and did not have any tests without a second opinion. It may take a bit more time, but more than once Lahey Clinic has helped me out. Overall , I felt it was worth the trip, and time well spent.As my daughter Lynn says, \"When you do not know what to do, listen to your gut!\" I took her advice and I am glad.Fancy Nancy Listens to Daughter Lynn!",

In fact my surgery was three hours, and although it was not fun, it was better than my previous experience. Well, today the packing is out, and at least for now, it is over. Next summer it will be time to do the other side. I am like the Newport Bridge. They start painting the bridge on one side, and then by the time they complete that side, then the other side needs work. It is the same with my teeth. I am never done. My dentists have no recession. I still have my teeth, and if I added up what they have cost, the numbers would look like our national debt. I guess we realize that even though one procedure has been done, there is always another one down the pike.The bottom line is you have to find professionals that you can work with, and if you are not happy, change. In the long run, it will be in your favor. Sometimes we hesitate to make a change, but if you are unhappy, try someone else. I did, and that has made a big difference.Fancy Nancy Encourages Change!",

I enjoyed doing the writing and I hope my readers will have fun with it. My daughter said, \" It would be great bathroom reading, since all the stories are mostly only one page. \" To celebrate, I decided to play my 5 hole golf at my favorite course, Goddard Park. Would you believe you only pay $6 if you walk the course. Since I am there for the exercise, I paid my $6 , put 5 clubs into my umbrella stroller , and I was on my way. I was happy to be playing alone, since I do not like to hold up better golfers. I only do 5 holes, and then call it a day. When people saw I was alone, they kept letting me go through, since most were foursomes. I seem to play better by myself, since I am more relaxed without others watching me. In any case, I am there for the walk, and I don't worry too much about my shots. The most amazing thing is the price. Even if I go to a driving range, the price is $6. Here I can play as long as I want for the same price. What a good deal. I don't know of any place in Florida where golf is so cheap. Usually, they don't let you walk, and you must use a golf cart. With my umbrella stroller and a few golf clubs, I had a nice two hour walk, and then came home and took a nap. Overall, a fun day. I am the only golfer with a baby carriage on the course. They said it was okay, and with permission, I headed onto the course. Perhaps this blog should be called, Cheap Golf with a baby carriage. Fancy Nancy on the Greens!",

In my last car we pushed the child-lock button and all our windows remained open. Not until we made an apt. with service were we able to fix the problem. We thought that we might have to replace the windows. This gives you some idea about our mechanical ability. Today when you buy a new product, you really need the salesperson to come and live with you for an extended period of time. Indeed, they are the only ones that understand the product. I got a 300 page book on the vehicle, and I think even an engineer would not know what they are saying. Does anyone ever read these manuals? My guess is that even if they read the thing, they still don't know what all the buttons and gadgets are for. I teach reading, and English; however, these manuals are probably written by engineers. As a result, the lay person has no idea what they are saying. My next career should be writing manuals for the average person. As a result we could knock off 297 pages of the booklet, and with luck 3 simple pages might do the job. Well, I may begin teaching for New England Technical Institute.

I need a passenger seat that adjusts. Finally, I discovered Acura . It is the only car that now has an adjustable passenger seat. Without a grand plan, I found the car I wanted, and with a tax savings on a trade, I now have an Acura with an adjustable front seat. I had three offers on my old car, but to be fair to everyone, I traded it for the new car. In addition, I was able to save on the sales tax. Sorry I could not please everyone who wanted my car, but this plan worked and it was simple. I am happy now that I can enjoy being a comfortable passenger in my own car. I was surprised to find this car, since I had never heard of it before last week.Tomorrow I start to teach again. This time I will do a program for the Y called Life Story Writing. It should be fun, since I still love to teach. My Best Wishes to All Happy 5770 Fancy Nancy",

All I know is that is seems that as we get older the years go faster. Is there anything special that makes is seems this way? Perhaps we think time is running out, but there are still just 24 hours in each day. Many of my friends say there are not enough hours in the day. None of them are young, but most seem to be quite busy . Perhaps the key is to decide how to make the best use of the time we are granted. I have a simple theory. A good day should include : Exercise for the mind and body, and a good deed for someone else. A simple formula, but I think it is effective.

Today I listened to an excellent professor talk about literature in the Depression. Some of the poetry sounded like what has been going on recently.  The speaker talked about socialism, and eugenics. At first I did not know what eugenics was, and then I learned it is the science of improving the species. Today I guess it is illegal, but during the Depression they actually operated on people who were considered morons , and the surgery was done to stop their ability to have children. This was done without the consent of the patient. Sounds like the same type of things done during the Holocaust. It seems that civilization is not civil yet.

        "content": "Today I went to see the newer model of my old Avalon Toyota. What I loved about that car was the adjustable passenger seat. Well was I suprised when they told me that feature is gone.Andy Rooney was wise when he said, if you find a product you like, get it when it is available. It may be gone later on. Well I took his advice on my comfortable Target shoes. I just bought 4 or 5 pairs in my size and they were being closed out. For some I only paid $14 per pair and so for under $100 I have lots of shoes. This same plan will not work for my cars. I am not able to invest extra money in extra cars unless they too are under $100. As a result, for the moment I am keeping my old Avalon with the great seat, and now pillows are helping my Honda Accord. I think Andy Rooney has a point. Often when a company has a good product you have to strike when the iron is hot. Too often that same feature is gone in a short amount of time. I am trying to think of other products that I loved and no longer exist. Can you think of any products that you loved that have now disappeared? Oh well, Kleenex is still out there, but the newer product sometimes has an added feature . Some Kleenex has an odor or another negative feature. I guess this is the way the manufacturer can justify a new price. I do like staying with products that work well. However, even my favorite washing machine detergent changed. They made ALL more powerful and more concentrated. I figured out their plan and now I add water to dilute the power and return the product to its prior status. Perhaps in my next career I will start to figure out how to reverse the questionable improvements that change good products. In this economy there is always room for a new expert. I will become the Product Reveral Specialist. My fee will be based on saving companies money by reverting back to original formulas that worked . Why reinvent a product when initally it works well? If you should see an ad in the paper for the Product Reversal Specialist, please contact me and I will apply for the job. After all, I am already doing just that with ALL for my washing machine. Send me an E-mail with the products you would like returned to their original status. Fancy Nancy Reversal Specialist",

There was no place to put a label. As a result, I kept scanning the same picture 4 times. I will try and find it online, but if I have no success I will have to find someone to help me out. Wow, this is a real new learning project. Fancy Nancy plods ahead!",

Today we started to return to reality. I went to the Y to exercise and find our if I will be teaching there this fall. I also got a call from a reporter who wants to interview me for the Charlestown newspaper about resume writing. I don't know how she knew that I teach that. In any case I sent her my reply and I will wait to hear from her. Next I will have to learn how to put pictures on my blog. I have so much to learn, but learning is fun. Now I have to dig through the mail. See you all online tomorrow. Fancy Nancy in Rhode Island",

        "content": "A Visit With A College FriendYesterday we visited my college classmate and she suprised us with another classmate who also visited for lunch. They have a lovely condo and enjoy life in California. We saw a book she has about the Jews who settled in Rhode Island and I was amazed to see Lena Blacher listed in the book. Lena was my grandmother. The brief article was written by Doris Hirsch and she talked about my grandmother's home in Oakland Beach. My dad said the house was swept away in the hurricane. I do not remember seeing the house, but he used to take me to see the ocean and he said he still paid taxes on the land, which was then under the water. I guess there was no flood insurance those days. We checked into our Hampton Inn near the airport and now we are getting ready to fly back to Rhode Island this afternoon. This has been a marvelous trip for both Marty and me. I know he really enjoyed spending time with his grandkids and sons. The trip worked well, and the hotels and car were a bonus. We are thankful we were able to enjoy this wonderful vacation. See you all soon. Love, Fancy Nancy",

        "content": "Barak Obama and Fancy NancyWhen I learn how to scan in a picture , you will see Fancy Nancy and our President. In the picture I am actually handing him a $10 bill. No, I am not doing anything illegal, just helping him out with the recession economy. Today we learned about a different President, Ronald Reagan. We visited his library and saw his plane Air Force One, which was suspended in his library. I did not go inside, since I am bad with heights, but everyone else said it was impressive. We also saw a replica of the Oval Office in the Whitehouse. No, Monica Lewinsky was not there, since Reagan never knew her. The building included a piece of the Berlin Wall which was removed during Reagan's term. That was a high point in his career. The Library has lots of interesting information, but in essence there are no books, so it is really a museum rather than a library. We were there for several hours and the best part was the air-conditioning. It was very hot today, but as the day went on there was a lovely breeze outside. We sat outside and enjoyed the gorgeous view of the mountains that surround the area. In California the mountains are everywhere. The Reagans sure picked a gorgeous spot for the library. They said he was buried nearby, but we never saw that. At night we went to David's restaurant for dinner. It has Mexican food, so I just ate the vegetables. They put too much spice in the food for my bland diet. Marty's grandkids have school tomorrow, so we are off to visit my college friend in Santa Ana. She just had ear surgery, so we can bond with ear information. This blog has been fun and thanks to Lori, my teacher , she now has me on a new track. Fancy Nancy flies home on Friday. We have had a wonderful trip and Marty's sons were super to us. We miss you all and look forward to reconnecting in Rhode Island. So far no ragweed here that I note, but it is high season in Narragansett. Hope the ragweed is not to bad this season. It is not my friend! Love to all, Fancy Nancy winding up her California trip. Adeios till tomorrow.",

        "content": "Up the Hill and Down the HillWe had a wonderful tour with David, Wendy , and the kids. We stopped for a delicious lunch and admired the scenery. There are beautiful mountains , and then the lovely ocean below. The mountains surround you, and the houses are built everywhere, even at the top of the mountains. Heaven knows what happens when they get rain and mud. Hopefully, the houses do not slide down the mountain. I could never live at the top of a mountain, since I hate high places.In the afternoon we visited an area like Coney Island. Lots of rides for the kids, lots of noise, and it was very warm. I finally found a shady spot, and turned my cochlear implant off for a while, to enjoy some peace and quiet. There are times where being deaf is a plus!After the kids had knocked themselves out on some rides, we left to go back to our hotel. Emily, David's 10 year old said she felt sick . I was not suprised since she had just completed a ride that would even get an space flyer upset. The ride turned her upside down many times, and just watching the ride could upset your stomach. I think this is the last time she will try that ride.At night we had dinner at their house. They got Chinese food, and we enjoyed seeing their lovely home. They have now been here five years and love the area.David, Marty's son manages 22 Mexican restaurants. He says they are doing okay in spite of the recession. Since places have been busy, I fail to see the recession during the short time we are here.Tomorrow we will reconnect with them. We drove home with out PT cruiser and luckily Marty brought his GPS. With that aboard, we were able to navigate finding our hotel again. Since we do not know the area, the signs are all strange to us. Many of the streets have Spanish names. Even though I have been taking Spanish this summer, all the names seem like Greek to us.I am enjoying this new blog. It seems like a good way to connect with others. Wendy also has a blog and will now travel with her blog group she met online. Who knows where my blog will take me! I will keep you posted. Fancy Nancy in California",

        "content": "Hi:  I am now in Los Angeles and we arrived by plane and got a marvelous deal on a car rental. We have a PT cruiser and it was a real bargain. When we had price rentals from Rhode Island the price was outrageous. Here they told us of a company called Pay Less. Indeed we did.We arrived at the Hampton Inn in Augoura Hills and we are waiting for Marty's son David to pick us up   at the hotel. We have enjoyed the Hampton Inns and they have helped us get some wonderful deals.The area looks very dry here.  They should rename the area. I call it , \" Up the Hill and Down the Hill\". There are many hills and mountains in Calif. and they are all brown and dry. Obviously, they have not had all the rains that we got in New England. As I look outside from  my computer there is a small mountain across the street and it does have green trees, but there is a lot of dry brown grass surrounding the trees.The weather here is much hotter than San Francisco. At night San Francisco was in the 50's and here is seems to stay much warmer.Flying in only took us about an hour and the airline only cost $59 . We  just learned that it makes a difference what time you fly. The prices vary by the hour you need your flight. It seems in traveling you learn something new each day.We look forward to connecting with Marty's son and grandkids shortly. They are due here and we hope to see them soon.Fancy Nancy en route!",

        "content": "I am in California now posting this new caption. What a nice experience to listen to Steve Forbes at THE MONEY STORE conference. I bought his book, and he even signed it.  We have spent the last few days in San Francisco touring and seeing the city like a native. We did not take the group tours, but instead we rode the local bus and really saw the people who live and work here.Our bus was packed and there are folks from all over the world who live here. It seems that many people from the Orient live here. I feel as if I am in China or Japan.The laws in San Francisco really protect seniors. Two different times folks on the bus got up to give me a seat. I guess that proves that I am getting older.The Federal law on the bus requires that seniors and disabled may use certain seats. I guess that is why they got up and asked me to sit down. Getting older can be fun.I do love traveling, and learning about a different location is stimulating. Today we went to the airport to book a car for Los Angeles. We have two deals, but I will probably take the easier one. With luggage it is not so easy to run around.I am amazed at hot dry the grass is here, compared to Rhode Island. I guess they do not get that much rain. There is always a mist over the hills and mountains, but it does not seem to make the grass greener.Yesterday we went over the Bay Bridge to Sausalito. Lots of tourists there. You only have to pay one way on the bridge, and the price is $6. No senior discounts here!We have enjoyed senior deals on Bart, the fast transportation system into downtown San Francisco. What a nice deal. We rode four trips for our senior ticket of only $9. A cab ride would have cost each trip about $40. It pays to ask for senior rates.I am happy to again be able to be on my blog. For a while I was not able to write, but it seems okay now. I will keep you posted.Fancy Nancy Traveling",
